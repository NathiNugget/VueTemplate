# Vue Template

This is my template repository for Vue applications

## Installation

Use Git clone in your terminal of choice [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathiNugget/VueTemplate.git
```
Doing this, you're not allowed to make any changes, though. 
Instead, you should use this as a template-repository when making a new repository through GitHub or another mirror.
